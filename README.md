# ProjectEuler

Solutions to Project Euler in C++ and Python are avaiable here. The code provided here is for reference only may contain bad code. Add reference to sources which helped me solve the problem in the code as a comment in the format(`Reference : reference_link`).

General code format for C++:
```C++
#include<iostream>

/*
 * Question written as comment
 */
 
 // Reference : reference_link (Only present for the questions, I took help from external sources)
 void func(){
    ...
 }
 int main(){
    func();
 }
 ```
 
 General code format for Python:
 
 ```python
 """
 Question written as comment
 """
 
 # Reference : reference_link (Only present for the questions, I took help from external sources)
 
 def func():
     pass
 
 func()
 ```
 
 

Code written in:
- **C++14** with gcc version **6.3.0** (MinGW.org **GCC-6.3.0-1**)
- **Cpython3.7.4**
